I am a software test engineer who recently encountered accessibility testing.
We adhere to WCAG 2.1 guidelines as a reference document.
I view this as a new challenge, particularly in terms of implementing accessibility testing using automation tools and determining the extent of testing required. 
For the project, I utilize Java 17 and Selenium. 

I would greatly appreciate any contributions or improvements to the existing code.
Thank you.
